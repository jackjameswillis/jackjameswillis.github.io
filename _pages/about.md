I'm a part-time PhD student at the University of Sussex supervised by Chris Buckley. I'm concerned with the concentration of AI-related capital (the AI artefacts themselves, GPUs, energy...) in the hands of the few, particularly those who already hold an excessive concentration of the capital prior to the recent AI funding boom. The open-source movement was thought to be a means of ensuring that this kind of thing didn't happen, but the reliance of models on GPUs makes simply sharing weights not enough. What is needed is a framework for distributed intelligence, where the public are empowered by supporting one another in each of the scaling law dimensions (parameters, compute, data), where centralization doesn't exist, and where collectively we can enable AI applications on a scale inaccessible to orgs concentrated in a single place.

Besides research I am interested in classic literature, particularly that which explores the psychology of the state, of religion, and also historical accounts of oppression of societies under invasion and occupation. Novels provide an insight into a time when invasion was a physical process, but I believe that invasion in modern times is a constant, passive process in flux through instantly accessible media via the internet, and through the social interactions between agents habituated to the invasive media. If you're interested in a book recommendation, I only have only one.

Ripped straight from the wiki: "A masterpiece....One of the best novels of our time....I know of no description of happiness in modern literature equal to the one that ends this novel." Guy Davenport, The New York Times Book Review
